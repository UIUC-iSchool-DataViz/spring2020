# Week 14 - Volume rendering for scientific viz, Wrap up with Idyll, Publishing Viz

We talk a little bit about publishing, and scientific viz - in particular, volume rendering - and carry on with Idyll.

A fun video [about rendering from Pixar is found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEzJH-JrAdw).

### Links & Code

 1. We'll be building toward a webpage like [this](https://jnaiman.github.io/) today using [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/)'s built-in components.
 1. Last week, we got to this [Markdown code right here](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week12/corg/inClass/index.idyll) and we'll start from there this week.
 1. Full Markdown code for this week and next week [available right here](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week14/corg/index.idyll).1. We'll also build a few histogram components like:
    * starting with [this one](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week14/corg/histogram-custom-d3-component.js)
    * then [this one](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week14/corg/histogram-button-custom-d3-component.js)
    * and finally [this one](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week14/corg/histogram-button-slider-custom-d3-component.js)
	
 Where we got to in class this week:
   * [This index.idyll](index.idyll) file

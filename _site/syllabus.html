<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>

<p>Data visualization is crucial to conveying information drawn from models,
observations or investigations. This course will provide an overview of
historical and modern techniques for visualizing data, drawing on
quantitative, statistical, and network-focused datasets. Topics will include
construction of communicative visualizations, the modern software ecosystem
of visualization, and techniques for aggregation and interpretation of data
through visualization. Particular attention will be paid to the Python
ecosystem and multi-dimensional quantitative datasets.</p>

<h1 id="land-acknowledgment">Land Acknowledgment</h1>

<p>As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has
a responsibility to acknowledge the historical context in which it exists. In
order to remind ourselves and our community, we will begin this event with the
following statement. We are currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia,
Peankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi,
Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these
Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an
institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community inclusive
of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our efforts.</p>

<p><a href="https://chancellor.illinois.edu/land_acknowledgement.html">More information can be found on the Chancellor’s
Website.</a></p>

<h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>

<p>This course is designed to give practical advice to students on
communicating data through visualization.  This will involve a considerable
amount of programming, and typically this programming will be done in Python.
For the most part, our data will be quantitative and multi-dimensional.  The
course will aim to provide both an understanding of what data visualizations
communicate and a set of tools for constructing them yourself.</p>

<p>The course will follow a common pattern within each three-hour instructional
session.  The first 60-90 minutes will be focused on lecture, where concepts
and tools will be introduced; typically, each class will focus on one type of
visualization or class of visualization.  The remaining time will include
exploration of a dataset, which may be independent or in groups, and then a
wrap-up session at the end.</p>

<p>Students are expected to have laptops with them, as well as access to Python
installations, and will be encouraged to participate in class.  Homework will
be assigned and collected utilizing the Jupyter nbgrader extension or through
other methods specified at time of submission like Moodle.</p>

<p>The central themes of the course are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are the components of an effective visualization of quantitative data?</li>
  <li>What tools and ecosystems are available for visualizing data?</li>
  <li>What systems can be put in place to generate visualizations rapidly and with
high-fidelity representation?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pre--and-co-requisites">Pre- and Co-requisites</h2>

<p>None, although basic Python programming experience is assumed.  A brief
introduction to Python will be presented during the course.</p>

<h1 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h1>

<p>There is no required textbook for this course.  All course materials will be posted to
the GitHub repository at https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020 .</p>

<h1 id="assignments-and-evaluation">Assignments and Evaluation</h1>

<p>Students will be graded based on a combination of assignments (70%: 40% standard prose/code assignments and
30% weekly visualization reports) and a final
project (30%).  The final project will be a capstone to the course, and will
have greater flexibility in software packages and data sources.  This project
will be introduced in Week 8.</p>

<p><strong>In summary, your grades consist of:</strong></p>

<p>Assignments in this course will be a mixture of coding/visualization work and
written work.  These two may not be distinct assignments; students will be
asked to describe their code and justify choices for making decisions with
respect to visualizations.</p>

<p>Students are expected, unless otherwise instructed, to be the principal authors
of their code.  This does not mean they may not investigate resources such as
StackOverflow, package documentation, etc; however, they <em>must</em> cite when
resources (especially StackOverflow and other “recipe” sites) are utilized.</p>

<p>Assignments will take two forms, and will be given at the end of each class.
Students will have until the following class to turn these in; assignments will
be collected electronically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first type of assignment will be a written document, constituting 
either a brief literature review or an analysis of a visualization or
set of visualizations.  The parameters for these assignments will be given
during class, but will typically involve a critique of a visualization,
including citing relevant works in the visualization literature.</li>
  <li>The second type of assignment will be a hands-on, code-based assignment.
Students will be provided either a dataset <em>or</em> a class of datasets from
which they can choose, and construct one or multiple mechanisms of drawing
information out of this visually.  These will be submitted in the form of
Jupyter notebooks.  Each visualization must be accompanied by narrative
description from the student describing why design decisions were made.</li>
</ul>

<p>The submission process for homeworks will be described by example during class
before any homeworks are to be submitted.</p>

<p>Each assignment will be 50% “correctness” and 50% the narrative description of
the process.  “Correctness” in this case indicates that the code runs without
issue, results are produced, and each component of the assignment is completed.
The narrative description of the process will be graded on grammar (less so) and
completeness (more so).</p>

<h3 id="grading-policy">Grading Policy</h3>

<p>All assignments are required for all students. Completing all assignments is
not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must be completed in order to
pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit
unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).</p>

<h2 id="emergency-response-run-hide-fight">Emergency Response: Run, Hide, Fight</h2>

<p>Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you – we have three options: Run, hide or
fight.</p>

<h3 id="run">Run</h3>

<p>Leaving the area quickly is the best option if it is safe to do so.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take time now to learn the different ways to leave your building.</li>
  <li>Leave personal items behind.</li>
  <li>Assist those who need help, but consider whether doing so puts
yourself at risk.</li>
  <li>Alert authorities of the emergency when it is safe to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hide">Hide</h3>

<p>When you can’t or don’t want to run, take shelter indoors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take time now to learn different ways to seek shelter in your building.</li>
  <li>If severe weather is imminent, go to the nearest indoor storm refuge area.</li>
  <li>If someone is trying to hurt you and you can’t evacuate, get to a place
where you can’t be seen, lock or barricade your area, silence your
phone, don’t make any noise and don’t come out until you receive an
Illini-Alert indicating it is safe to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fight">Fight</h3>

<p>As a last resort, you may need to fight to increase your chances of
survival.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think about what kind of common items are in your area which you
can use to defend yourself.</li>
  <li>Team up with others to fight if the situation allows.</li>
  <li>Mentally prepare yourself – you may be in a fight for your life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be aware of persons with disabilities who may need additional
assistance in emergency situations.</p>

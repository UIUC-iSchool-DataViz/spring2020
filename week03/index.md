# Week 3 - Types of Viz and Choosing Colors

This week, we will cover a bit about colors, and more about data transformations, and how we can
choose colors and transforms to better suit our data.

We also did some basics of Pandas last week and we'll continue this week.

Note there are a variety of notebooks from previous iterations of this course listed under the *Materials* subsection of today's lecture.  The "furtherExamples" notebooks are just there as reference, we will not be going through them by hand.
